Each change in the outline is reflected across all open sessions within a few seconds without overwriting ongoing modifications.

Features
- Real-time collaboration on outline editing.
- Ability to add, delete, and modify items within the outline.
- Persistent ordering of outline items.
- The outline structure supports a hierarchical (tree-like) organization.
